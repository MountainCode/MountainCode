# About Me

Hello, I'm Chris Kentfield and I'm a life-long software developer,
problem solver, snowboarder and outdoors person.

My interest in programming started at seven years old writing simple
Commodore 64 BASIC programs. Since then I've continued studying new
software technologies, techniques, patterns and paradigms. What I
especially enjoy is learning computer science topics and translating
theory to practical application. Having a deep understanding of a
variety of solutions enables me to evaluate trade-offs and choose an
approach that is a good fit for each project.

I'm very good at solving problems independently and getting things done.
One of my best strengths is my ability to understand complex systems
quickly then to decompose and simplify them which means I'm very good at
upgrading legacy systems.

I've been doing professional full-stack web developer for 17
years. The majority of my experience is with Câ™¯, JavaScript and SQL
Server, but I have worked on systems built on Java and Ruby as
well. I've been developing e-commerce sites most of my career with a
few years spent on real estate websites.
